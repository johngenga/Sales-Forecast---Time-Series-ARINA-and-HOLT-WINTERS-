# Sales-Forecast---Time-Series-ARINA-and-HOLT-WINTERS-

A sales forecasting tool that can be used by anyone easily. It is simply generic and uses both ARINA and HOLT_WINTERS series for comparison.Sales Forecasting Tool - Time Series Analysis
Overview

This Sales Forecasting Tool leverages advanced time series models, including ARIMA and Holt-Winters, to predict sales for a single SKU. Developed with Python, this tool is designed to assist businesses in making informed decisions by accurately forecasting future sales based on historical data.
Key Features

    ARIMA Model: A powerful statistical approach for modeling and forecasting time series data, ideal for capturing trends and seasonality.
    Holt-Winters Method: A robust model that extends exponential smoothing to capture seasonal variations and trends in sales data.
    Data Visualization: The tool includes comprehensive visualizations to help users understand the underlying patterns in their data.
    User-Friendly Interface: Clear and well-documented code, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users.
    Customizable: Flexible implementation allowing users to adjust parameters to fit their specific use case.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Python 3.7+
    Pandas: For data manipulation.
    NumPy: For numerical operations.
    Matplotlib/Seaborn: For plotting and visualizations.
    Statsmodels: For time series modeling.
    Scikit-learn: For additional data preprocessing.

Installation

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/johngenga/Sales-Forecast---Time-Series-ARINA-and-HOLT-WINTERS-
cd Sales-Forecast---Time-Series-ARINA-and-HOLT-WINTERS-

Install the required packages:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the main script to generate forecasts:

bash

    python main.py

Usage

    Load your sales data: Ensure your sales data is formatted correctly (date and sales columns).
    Select the forecasting model: Choose between ARIMA and Holt-Winters depending on your data's characteristics.
    Run the forecast: The tool will process your data, apply the selected model, and output both numerical forecasts and visualizations.
    Interpret the results: Use the visualizations and model outputs to guide your sales planning and decision-making.

Example

python

# Import necessary modules
from forecasting_tool import ARIMA_Model, HoltWinters_Model

# Load your dataset
data = pd.read_csv('your_sales_data.csv')

# Initialize the ARIMA model
arima = ARIMA_Model(data)
arima.fit()
arima.plot_forecast()

# Initialize the Holt-Winters model
holt_winters = HoltWinters_Model(data)
holt_winters.fit()
holt_winters.plot_forecast()

Visualizations

    Time Series Plot: Visualize the historical sales data.
    Forecast Plot: View the model's predictions and confidence intervals.
    Model Comparison: Compare different models to choose the best fit for your data.
